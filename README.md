Introduction
This post is about me and why I started this blog

My full name is Tran Anh Quan, I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2004.
The reason I am writing this blog is to give my thoughts and feelings about programming.
I chose this topic for blogging because simply coding is my hobby.
In particular, I feel excited every time I find the optimal solution for a certain problem. 
It could be faster, take less memory, or be simpler than my original way.
